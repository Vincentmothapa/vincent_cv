	<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
		
		<p>In 2012 I started my journey towards becoming an engineer. I completed my Bachelor of Science in
			Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town. I chose Electrical Engineering as I am an
			individual who is interested in technology and renewable energy. My interest in renewable energy
			was sparked in high school when I learnt about generators and I could see all the possibilities and
			energy generation projects to help small towns. Currently, I am working on completing the Software 
			Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev. I chose Software Engineering as Covid19 made it harder for 
			new graduates to get into the workforce and I wanted to spend my time improving my skillset and 
			exploring another area of interest.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am convinced I would succeed in either field as teamwork and design thinking are some of my
			strongest points, considering the skillset I have acquired up to this point. I am fully equipped 
			with not only the technical skills required of an engineer, but also the soft skills necessary to 
			ensure success in my chosen field. I have extensive experience with report writing and presenting 
			my work to a lot of people. Most projects throughout university and during my vac work experience 
			have been in teams, and involved learning to work with people from different backgrounds with 
			different ways of thinking.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am actively looking for job opportunities and am willing to relocate.

						<li>Substation Testing</li>
						<li>Protection Relay Testing</li>
						<li>Protection Relay Configuration and Coordination</li>
					</ul>
				
				<b>Powertech Transformers (01/2014 - 01/2014)</b>	
				<br>I was exposed to the design and testing of transformers and their operation. I got to work in the
					factory assembling transformers and testing them.

			<h3>Maths and Physics Tutor (06/2012 - Present)</h3>
				<p>I have been taking tutoring jobs since 2012 during university holidays at my local high schools 
					and privately as students needed the help. One of my greatest achievements was helping a grade 12
					learner in 2021 move from failing in her June exams to passing grade 12 and being admitted to an
					institution of higher learning.</p>
				<p>	I was also hired by the Matatiele Department of Education to join their 2013 Grade 12 winter 
					school program as one of the mathematics teachers. I was tasked with two topics which students 
					in the district struggled with the most, namely Calculus and Euclidean Geometry.

			<h3>Poised Building Project Manager</h3>
				The program consists of two object: Person and Project. Project information 
					is stored in a text file and person's information is stored in it's own text 
					file. The functionality is summarized below:
					<ul><li>Capture new project information.</li>
					<li>Update information about existing projects</li>
					<li>Finalize existing projects and generate an invoice - The invoice is generated if 
					there is payment is still due.</li>
					<li>See projects that are still in progress - You can see all projects or choose to 
					see an individual project's information</li>
					<li>See projects that are past their due date</li>
					<li>See projects that have been finalized</li></ul>

			<h3>Task Manager</h3>	
				<p>The task manager keeps track of the various tasks assigned to various users. A user 
				and tasks can be added by the admin user and a user cannot access information unless 
				they have been registered by admin. The user's username and password are stored in user.txt 
				and the various tasks are stored in tasks.txt. The format that users are added and tasks 
				are written should be strictly adhered to. 
				</p>
				
				<p>Reports are generated with the relevant stats like the number of completed tasks and 
				tasks that are overdue and so on and saved to task_overview.txt. User stats are also 
				generated and saved to user_overview.txt. User stats include number of users registered,
				total number of tasks assigned to each user, tasks assign to the user that have been 
				completed, and so on.</p>

			<h3>Design of Loss of Grid Protection Scheme for Microgrid Clusters Integrated to Distribution 
				Level in a Utility Network</h3>	
				This was my final year project. The project is about the design of a protection scheme
				for a microgrid cluster that is connected to the utility grid. The protection scheme could 
				be either voltage based or frequency based. Literature was reviewed concerning the various 
				options there are for protecting microgrids and a frequency based scheme was selected to 
				this setup. The frequency based scheme selected uses the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) relay.
				<br>
				<br>
				The system was put together that would be used to simulate the faults that were to be used 
				for testing the ROCOF relay. The microgrid cluster consists of 2 microgrids that are powered 
				by wind and PV based distributed generators respectively. Suitable components for the network 
				system were selected. Three case studies were considered:
				<ul><li>Case 1: Single line-to-ground fault</li>
					<li>Case 2: 3-phase fault</li>
					<li>Case 3: Microgrid fault</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				The above cases were selected because they are the most common fault type and the most 
				severe fault type respectively. The last case was a fault on one of the microgrids. The 
				designed ROCOF relay managed to detect all the fault types and successfully trigger the 
				CBs to open.</p>

			<h3>New Venture Planning Business Plan</h3>
				As part of the New Venture Planning course we were require to initiate a business venture. 
				We came up with SavvySwitch, a company that designs and produces and sells a plug that monitors 
				and controls the power consumption of a wall socket. This was a business venture with 4 other 
				classmates. The switch had a digital screen to display instantaneous power consumption and 
				could also be monitored and controlled remotely via a smartphone app. The final business plan 
				included:
				<ul><li>Production Description</li>
					<li>Market Analysis</li>
					<li>Financial Planning</li>
					<li>Operations</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Electrification of the Zithulele Community</h3>
				<p>Electrification of Zithulele South, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Zithulele is a remote 
				area that had no electricity until the government started the project of electrification. This is 
				the design of the electrification for that area as part of the Power Distribution and Transmission 
				Networks course requirements.</p>
